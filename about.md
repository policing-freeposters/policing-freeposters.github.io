*Make our spaces policing-free* is a place where creatives, dreamers, and revolutionaries can share poster art with others to facilitate policing-free spaces. 

Anyone can submit poster art or download poster art to place in their spaces, apartment buildings, homes, workplaces, schools, neighbourhoods, and so forth.

Poster art can be stylised in any way but ought to convey a policing-free message using one of the titles provided: Policing Free Space, Policing Free Floor, Policing Free Building, Policing Free School, Policing Free Neighbourhood. 

Have an idea for a different message? Want to submit a poster? Have any questions? You can reach us at policing-freeposters@proton.me
